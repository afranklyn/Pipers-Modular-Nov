    <h2 class="big-bold"> Level 3 Takeaway </h2>
    <p>Level 3 comes into place on Tuesday 28 April and we are so excited to be able to open again.
     </p>
     <p>Coffee will be available from 8am on Tuesday morning and we will kick off our new takeaway menu from 4pm which includes all of our usual takeaway burgers and pizzas plus a new range of heat-and-eat meals you can have at home.
     </p>
    <p>From Wednesday, we will have a reduced breakfast menu from 8am to 12noon and you’ll be able to pick up heat-and-eat meals all day long, with takeaway burgers and pizzas available from 12noon.
      </p>
      <p>Please order in the courtyard and note that payments will be cashless.

Food can be ordered over the phone and paid for when you pick it up. We can also deliver in Matarangi for orders over $20 or for people who cannot leave the house.
        </p>
      <p>There will be a bit of trial and error as we get used to these new ways of operating, so let us know what you like and what you don’t and we’ll try our best to keep you well fed!
